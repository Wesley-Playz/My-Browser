# My-Browser

My Browser is a browser that I made because I was bored


If you want to build it yourself I would recommend editing the files in Visual Studio 2022 then running CMD in the project folder (the one with the sln file) and running this command: `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true`.
